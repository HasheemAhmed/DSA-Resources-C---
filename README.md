# 📚 Resources for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++

Welcome to the Resources for DSA in C++ repository! This repository contains various data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. Each file is named after the data structure or algorithm it contains, making it easy to find and understand the concepts.

## 📖 Description

This repository provides implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in C++. It is designed to help users better understand the concepts by compiling and running the provided code files.

## 🛠️ Installation

To compile and run the code, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Compile any of the code files:
2. Run the compiled file:


## 🚀 Usage

Each file in this repository corresponds to a specific data structure or algorithm. For example, to understand and run the singly linked list implementation, navigate to the file `singly_linked_list.cpp`, compile it, and execute the output file.

## 🌟 Features

- **Linked Lists**: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List
- **Trees**: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort
- **Other Data Structures**: Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables
